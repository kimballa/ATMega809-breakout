Hello,

Thank you for making my PCB! I'm looking forward to seeing the results.

Here are a few manufacturing notes:

* U2 is 48-pin TQFP. 0.22mm between pins. Please eliminate solder dams in U2.

* USB Connector J1 overhangs PCB edge by 0.8mm. Adam Tech MPN is MCR-B-S-RA-SMT-CS5A-NF-T/R; this does /not/ have flanges. Please let me know if this is a problem.

* I have added 3 board fiducials and 2 local fiducials for U2. If you do not need these I can remove them for you, please let me know.

* Please note slightly rounded corners for edge milling.

If you have any questions, or there are difficulties to address please send me an email.

Thank you,
Aaron Kimball
