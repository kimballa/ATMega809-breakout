Hello,

Thank you for making my PCB! I'm looking forward to seeing the results.

Here are a few manufacturing notes:

* U2 is 48-pin TQFP. 0.22mm between pins. Please eliminate solder dams in U2.

* USB Connector J1 goes right to the PCB edge. Molex MPN 0473461001. This does /not/ have flanges hanging down, it should lay flat on surface. Please let me know if this is a problem. 

* I have added 3 board fiducials and 2 local fiducials for U2. If these interfere with your localizing system I can remove them for you.

* Please note slightly rounded corners for edge milling.

If you have any questions, or there are difficulties to address please send me an email.

Thank you,
Aaron Kimball
